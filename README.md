Land of Desolation is a browser-based post-apocalyptic RPG in the style of Land of Devastation

## Ideas & todos
- Secret locations: not shown as icons on map, but can be activated via quests, random encounter etc (e.g a quest flag set -> go to x,y -> initiate dialogue/location/event/combat etc)
- Random encounters/events other than combat. Quest type stuff, randomly find items, randomly take damage/set various flags/get effects etc.
- Vehicles: either land or air (terrain_types has fields impassable_foot, impassable_vehicle, impassable_air). Air vehicle could be a gyrocopter (woo mad max!), to bypass walls or high mountains for instance. Also make sure we only encounter air-type enemies if flying.
  - Fuel: fuel sources, conversions, fuel consumption etc. Vehicle marker on map for vehicles that you've left or that has run out of fuel (also possibility to bring batteries/jerrycans to them to refuel).
  - Simple repair/damage system? Maybe you can find vehicles at locations or random encounters that needs repair or spare parts before you can use them
- Stamina/thirst/hunger system. Able to drink water from map water features (with risk for poisoning?).
- Persistent/temporary effects: Irradiated, sick, poisoned etc)?
- Engagement "steps" like in NeoScavenger. Most should follow the normal LOD routine of 1 turn of LR combat, then SR combat, but maybe skills, perks, terrain, vehicles, equipment etc could give the chance of having multiple LR rounds or disengaging from SR to LR again etc?
- Familiars! Dog, parrot, rat, wolf(?), robot?
- Hidden stash - if you have a shovel you can bury items in the ground. Shows a marker only for you on the map. Others can find it by searching (chance based - can be affected by SCANNERS).
- A trade route/caravan system ("offmap") for forts? If fort X sets up a trade route somewhere it should leave every X timeperiod and return Y. While in this timeframe, calculate a fuzzy "path" that if any other player is in that area they have a chance of randomly encountering it (trade or combat). Also think about forts along the route with toll stations and/or prox-weapons
- Personal mapper. Every map tile you discover will be written to the characters "map", which is unavailable unless you have a datapad and the program "MAPPER".
- Dialogue system. Hyoerlinked words. Check flags and/or AIDES skill rolls for various things.
- Faction reputation/standings. Plus or minus for certain actions. Unlocks/locks certain stuff (maybe locations become unavailable/available depending on standing, or certain functions inside a location turn on/off etc).
- Armor slots? "Head", "Body", "Legs"?
- Vehicles:
  - BMX Bike - no inventory - no fuel
  - Motorcycle - no inventory - consumes guzzoline
  - Motorcycle w/ sidecar - slight inventory - consumes guzzoline
  - Dune buggy - slight inventory - consumes guzzoline
  - Car - big inventory - consumes guzzoline
  - EV car - big inventory - consumes energy packs
  - Gyrocopter - no inventory - consumes guzzoline
  - Inflatable raft - no inventory - no fuel
- How does having a land-vehicle affect traveling overland? Less stamina loss (terrain_types have `drag` which cause stamina loss). We're not really able to simulate "speed" as every "turn" is one movement anyways.
